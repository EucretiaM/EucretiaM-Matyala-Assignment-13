#Branch Protection

####Branch Protection is an essential suite of features designed to secure developers’ code by enforcing specific ###rules on git branches, crucial for maintaining code standards and security in a collaborative environment
###In a nutshell you can protect important branches by setting branch protection rules, which define whether ###collaborators can delete or force push to the branch and set requirements for any pushes to the branch, such as ###passing status checks or a linear commit history.
###Branch protection avoids negative impact on production code when illegal commits have been pushed to the main ###branch. The Main branch represents production code ready for deployment, so committing broken code to the main ###branch leads to broken production code. That’s why restrictions need to be imposed on the main branch,

###A review by all collaborators and their consensus allow the code to be committed to the main branch.
